\arguments{
\item{score.v}{Named vector of scores of features to select driver nodes.}

\item{pwy.tab}{A table of pathway results.}

\item{feat.tab}{Table of feature (e.g. gene) statistics.}

\item{Gmat}{Binary feature (e.g. gene) by pathway inclusion matrix, indicating which features are in which pathways.}

\item{ker}{Laplacian kernel matrix.}

\item{name}{Name for the folder and Excel file that get written. Set to \code{NA} to avoid writing output.}

\item{alternative}{Alternative hypothesis; must be one of \code{"two.sided"}, \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}.

\description{
Create directory; write CSV files with stats from \code{feat.tab} for all features in each pathway, and the top
